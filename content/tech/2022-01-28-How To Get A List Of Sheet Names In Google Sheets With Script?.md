There's no built-in formula to do this, and we have to write our own script with Google's Apps Script to achieve the function.

1. First, go to the Extensions â†’ Apps Script.

2. Second, write our own method getSheetsName in the Apps Script console, and save.

Code snippets:
``` js
function getSheetsName() {
var sheetNames = new Array()
var sheets = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheets();
for (var i=0 ; i<sheets.length ; i++) {
sheetNames.push( [ sheets[i].getName() ] )
}
return sheetNames
}
```
Then go back to your sheet, and type the formula with the function name we just created in the Apps Script.
